New Smart Module: Pack
Includes two new types of actions compared to Example NFT. insertNFT (into a pack by Admin/Minter) and retrieveNFTs (from a pack by pack holder)
Won't work with ExampleNFT because ExampleNFT does not conform to the NFT standard on Flow.
So the module can either only be used with NFTs that conform to the standard or it would have to be changed to only work with ExampleNFT
